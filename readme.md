# AAC Speech

## What is AAC?
Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism.
## Tools used in AAC
AAC tools can be high tech options such as speech generating devices, low-tech options, such as symbol boards and communication books, as well as no-tech options such as Key Word Signing. In recent years, many people have started using the iPad for AAC.
## What is this project is about?
So are we trying to re-invent the wheel here? ..No
* Most of the existing Apps are either pricy ($100 to $150) or free ones are with distracting advertisements
* The quality ones are mostly designed for iPad (iOS eco system – for obvious reasons)
* There is nothing I could find cloud connected
    * Where teacher/therapist can log-in in his/her device and customize the picture cards for a child/student
    * Child can use his/her device and see the customized picture cards pushed by teacher
    * Have location specific intelligence, which will help the kid to get the picture card quickly based on situation
        *  At home what could be kid’s communication needs 
        *  At school what could be kid’s need
        *  At a super market what could be kid’s needs
* More importantly, it is going to be “Free” in both App Store and Play Store

## What do we have now?
A super simple App, built using React Native, having basic picture card features, I would say it is just a working prototype with simple features – Published in Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aacspeech
## How you can contribute?
If you are interested in building this App along with me during your free time, there is a back-log of features to be added and we can work together, there is no timeline for this work, we can make progress as and when we get sometime. My contact info bindukaladeepan@gmail.com
